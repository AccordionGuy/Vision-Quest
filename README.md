Vision Quest uses Core ML to perform object recognition on images in the center of the iPhone cameraâ€™s field of vision. The user can taps on the screen, and Core ML is used to identify the object in the center. The app then uses ARKit to draw an AR label over the object.

This app was the fourth of four apps that I presented for the ARKit Workshop at the [RWDevCon 2018 conference.](https://www.rwdevcon.com/) I built the app in front of the audience, who were invited to code along with me.
